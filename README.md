# ActiveRecord Lite

Metaprogramming exercise to clone ActiveRecord through Ruby and SQLite to grasp how ActiveRecords's ORM features run behind the scens. Implemented:

* Avility to define a Record object that can mass-assign attributes
* CRUD to database
* Relation method "where" to run a SQL query with proper parameters.
* AR's "belongs to", "has many", "has one through" associations.

## Testing

Run the specs.
